## Assignment
### Assignment 1
Bringing together all skills learnt from the Exercises to complete assignment 1. The assignment is a project that monitors the temperature, ID and timestamp of multiple sensors (Clients) then it sends packets back to the user (Server). Started with stating the Server IP address and port and client IP address. From there we created a UDP server that was listening for incoming packets from clients. Then created one UDP client to test that the client could send a packet and the server could receive one aswell. Started small by sending and receiving a message so that I knew the connection would work then built from there. 

### How to Run
There is a more detailed how to run in the howToRun.md inside the Documentation folder inside the Assignment 1 folder but for now, in the directory of Source folder.

```python
python main.py
```
